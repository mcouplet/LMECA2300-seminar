Numerical Geometry Project
==========================

This folder is the canvas for your upcoming project.
It should contain:
 * this file (**README.md**)
 * the description of the structure of the program in **CMakeLists.txt**
 * a **src** directory containing the the source code of your program
 * a **doc** directory containing more documentation
 * a **deps** directory containing the draw_tools library

See [doc/COMPILING.md](doc/COMPILING.md) for a step by step tutorial
on how to build the program.

See [doc/tutorial.md](doc/tutorial.md) for a step by step tutorial on
how to use the draw_tools library.

See [deps/draw_tools/include/draw_tools.h](deps/draw_tools/include/draw_tools.h)
for help on the draw_tools library functions.

See [deps/draw_tools/examples/](deps/draw_tools/examples/) for more
examples using the draw_tools library
